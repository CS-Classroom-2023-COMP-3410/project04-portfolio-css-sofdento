I first began by implementing the bulma framework to every page. The next thing was to change the colors to match my pink theme. Then, I had some issues with the layout of vaious images. I worked together with chatgpt to figure out how to get all the images to lay how i want them. It was difficult to make it so the images in the favorites section lay next to each other under the table, but even more difficult to then make it so the gallery images go 2 per row on large screens and then one on small screens while maintaining good sizing. I ended up going to just one column and then making it two from there. Then I changed the fonts to feel more me.
